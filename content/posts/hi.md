Welcome to my blog. This is where you’ll be able to read many of my ramblings about a variety of subjects, ranging from run-of-the-mill software development, to my personal experiences of burnout and the importance of placing value on your own mental health.

Being self-taught, I regularly suffer from imposter syndrome. I also I have a pretty significant fear of public speaking (the title of this post is a nod to how I awkwardly join Zoom meetings at work; more to come on this in a future post). To combat these fears, I plan on broadcasting some live streams, as I begin my journey into learning [Rust](https://rustlang.org).

My hope is that as you watch me fumble around and undoubtedly make many mistakes, it will shed light on my learning process and will help others who may suffer from imposter syndrome see the hard work behind many well articulated blogs or conference talks.

Over the coming months I’ll aim to live stream as much of my journey as possible, from the mundane of setting up my development environment and working through The Book, all the way to building a distributed KV Store - With my recent decision to install Windows 10 on my personal laptop (I’m an avid Mac and Linux user), as well as switching to an Ergodox-EZ keyboard, expect some rather interesting live streams as I navigate all of these things.

Anyway, this was enough of an intro, I hope you enjoy my future posts / streams.
