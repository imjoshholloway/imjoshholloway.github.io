I am a self-taught Software Engineer from a small, fairly insignificant town called Andover in the UK.

Currently I'm at [@Splunk](https://splunk.com) where I’ve been for the past 3 ½ years. Over that time I have learnt a great deal about the challenges of scaling enterprise systems in Cloud as well as the challenges of remote work.

I believe in pragmatic solutions and strive for simplicity.

I'm a massive fan of [Go](https://golang.org).
